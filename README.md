This is my official website! Featuring draggable windows, interactable objects/audio, and a functional email form, this website emulates the feel of a working browser - inside your very own browser!

I built this website not only to show off my Frontend coding skills, but to also host my important links and documentation all in one place for easy access. I took a lot of inspiration from one of my favorite artists & software developers Sharlene Yap. Overall, I'm very proud of myself for the effort that I put into this project. I've learned so much, and I'm extremely happy that I was able to make it as awesome as it is!
